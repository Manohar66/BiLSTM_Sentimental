weeks charged every days so gives approximate days battery gps wifi data network on but that s me play much phone heavy using apps social ones there application called lenovo power manages battery smart way lasts longer suggest learn use it ok opening back case nothing short easy little dent lower right side allows pull back case fast easy inside find standard sized sim card slots micro sd slot

1390,pros smooth performance all day battery life excellent build quality good quality screen nfc android pay compatible decent camera microsd expansioncons awkward button placement squeaky vibrating motor updates guaranteed no gorilla glassshould buy yesactual value i loved moto g made always question people spend phones could work well with new moto g willing buy right spot but turned nearly weeks i d wait delivered so started search next best lead i ve experience alcatel phones didn t much expectations that said i ve couple days say absolute confidence love it design this light i m starting idea light hold hand actually thought moment battery wasn t inside yet but pleasant hold hand design plastic don t expect anything premium metal but solidly built rivaling even galaxy s build quality speaking which lighter slimmer s if sold money i d still satisfied it s build quality price it s excellent build quality period chrome accent nice touch speaker grills slightly angled towards phone add bit sparkle otherwise black no soft touch plastic phone land middle ground plastic nice touch resistant fingerprints design completely symmetrical important certain feature unique it i d love even available different color white personal preference overall can t find much complain especially low price performance if seen moto g s specs you re pretty much getting hardware uses snapdragon p display microsd expansion android lollipop even camera module sony imx however key difference make better moto g for instance gb ram moto g gb actual front facing stereo speakers compared nfc gb storage moto g gb in benchmarks gotten similar results moto g cpu graphic performance but benchmarks side performance experience daily user experience based couple days installing many apps tell snappy it s fast current flagship lineup never lags clips graphics apps open relatively quickly animations smooth well transitions app another in testing multitasking ability opened chrome angry birds pokemon puzzle youtube lag app open left off opening force suspend apps save ram apps without closing pretty cost games also perform good long reasonable expectations d games angry birds pokemon puzzle clash clans run smoothly without issue other games asphalt real racing run smooth highest quality setting but that s expected midrange signal quality good able get mbps download speed mbps upload t mobile s g lte around pasadena ca thanks band support cell signal buildings signal almost never going bars speakers also amazingly loud coming close matching htc s boomsound speakers thanks help jbl overall performs close flagship specs albeit bit slower most people happy phone display the beautiful hd display ppi note iphone ppi advertise calibrated technicolor while aren t s s quality display come close display nice color calibration vivid colors nice blacks whites also bright enough using even direct sunlight contrast means clearly see doing isn t perfect since couple issues colors very slight cool tone meaning whites tiny bit blue them another small issue slight amount light bleed side displace but isn t noticeable daily use price one crucial fact aren t using gorilla glass display opting discreet dragontrail glass since going daily driver didn t want test toughness if alcatel provides unit i d gladly test it i ve looked trades scratch resistance toughness might easier scratch it resistant shock only time tell update review time moves on camera the camera back facing mp camera front wide angle mp camera rear camera uses sony exmor imx unit found new moto g expensive nexus results mixed though on side outdoor pictures good whenever lighting outside well lit room pictures come high quality colors mostly accurate camera absorbing lot details however night picture quality takes hit camera struggling get details lack light get details any type light much lack ois also contributes issue ois price range moment flash okay since isn t dual tone unit light tends overflow photos tend lose details videos also similar story lighting providing results opposite true there eis effect isn t noticeable doesn t really help quality isn t camera you re going use important memorable moments but things people use facebook twitter instagram works great especially true front facing camera selfie cam grabbing lot details provided amount light software this basically running close stock version android lollipop running version stagefright patch already added protect foreign attacks there changes software for instance icons look similar iphone bad thing depending whether love hate style other that everything works stock android except feature i m surprised isn t universal phones that fact reversible doesn t sound exciting fingerprint sensor rather practical underrated feature i ve answered test sound quality wasn t hung realized upside down sounds equally either orientation brilliant of course don t for reason always option turn off overall light touch alcatel added onto android hasn t hurt much problems easily fixed conclusion i wasn t expecting get high quality phone especially experience old model can t even remember name but alcatel deliver high quality experience astonishing device compromises alcatel chose wisely overall result great there couple phones compete range biggest moto g is better yes no for power users would still recommend high end moto g extra ram even oneplus one sale but must college students me beats low end moto g due higher quality speakers display nfc slightly ram helps answer question do people really need spend get high quality experience answer people no they don t there market people need latest greatest new extras fingerprint sensor dslr like quality cameras but rest us ask reasonably well price overall if fence frustrated searching was let help you go won t disappointed
1392,so far good awesome speakers little phone can t beat price
1393,as late i ve something phone journey first purchased idol darn big practical at least me returned it picked new moto g which also review on excellent phone end discovered missing key features really needed daily driver device first moto g missing notification led sure may think who cares moto display times optimal when desk happened miss notification which normally flashed times sometimes once probably bugged find even either reach across desk wave hand device pick would activate screen which always work either physically hit power button a notification led eliminates need fuss that light going blink check clear notifications perfect moto g also missing gyroscope not overly important most time useful things degree youtube videos certain games etc another win alcatel moto g include magnetometer wanna use compass app moto g too bad sad alcatel motorola no nfc moto g wanna pay using android pay future well can t moto g idol strikes again only gb internal storage similarly priced moto g what s that you want gb don t worry alcatel covered moto g offers gb ram model while gb sufficient careful usage i ll gladly take gb price thanks idol the screen while resolutions x idol sports ppi pixel density moto g comes more pixels more clarity yup i ll take it dual front facing speakers jbl sound they sound absolutely amazing moto g least decency speaker front zero contest here these speakers sound ones idol while positives wanted lay comparisons idol moto g gb model often compared devices in honest opinion zero contest two feel alcatel amazing job device at first bit leery ghz quad core cpu i ve zero issues lollipop everything buttery smooth fully recommend anyone well worth price admission

1648,love started crashing often alcatel fix would purchase nothing happens
1651,seemed buy time having owned see major shortcomings useless alarm clock completely unreliable sometimes goes right time many times not takes away half functionality os grant many apps write permissions sd card app ask it send system screen system screen show sd card call support say app s fault these apps downloaded tens millions times rocket player es file browser they say straight face use stock apps provide stunned as pretty big screen is not healthy eyes hoping read it stopped that no sub screen eg decent size tablet comfortable reading likely stuck lollipop forever not even very disappointing would recommend late edit after upgrading android marshmallow problems went away thanks updating alcatel now nice cheap slowish big reliable smart i m happy hope lives see android n

1658,arrived two days early great buy far still need take photos good battery life sb no option turn swipe open needs slim case slippery
1659,switched oneplus one is worth switch depends mid range main reason switched phones supports band t mobile s lte network where oneplus one supports band although oneplus one s performance better bug issues cyanogen cm oxygen os versions android lollipop plus people end complaining can t hear clearly pros good screen quality bright good sound quality with jbl dual front facing speakers plastic build feel cheap has nice brushed effect band support t mobile s lte network battery lasts whole day expandable storage microsd card gb mp back mp front camera reversible decent quality earbuds included good call quality person hear clearly pricecons screen quality bright side get dark enough turned way down had use screen filter app make screen dimmer lowest setting camera sound mic quality good performance issues can lag freeze certain apps its software issue alcatel sent update helped little still completely resolved hoping alcatel send another update soon snapchat noticeable performance issues snapdragon enough power handle performance since lower ranged phones handle snapchat issues alcatel s light skin android lollipop ok would better left stock android
1660,far had problem screen going call so hang up turned proximity sensor dust needed blown out earphone jack open many apps try music sd card studder but works part
1661,great price you get awesome inch display crisp loud front facing jbl speakers free quality jbl ear buds fast easily rival samsung galaxy s received morning simply can t put down sat wife next enjoy beauty together lol the front facing speakers really make difference doubt i ll ever go back back facing speakers alcatel really us favor awesome beast can t beat price

1663,i m going get many explicit specs trying review real world does it work perspective don t care benchmarks care able use everyday life if want every technical detail go here hardware screenthe idol inch p ips screen back plastic back removable so battery swapping there faux chrome accents go around device speakers dual front facing later tippy top bottom feels pretty nice hand wasn t hard hold the screen fantastic best features alcatel uses buzz words describe technicolor simplest way put screen vivid bright crystal clear it s flagship level would require qhd screen lacks resolution vs something lg g samsung galaxy s makes cheaper off contract flagship device simply put idol s screen nice doesn t feel cheap my favorite hardware feature inclusion mircosd slot next sim card slot which tray that s ejected left side phone basically can t buy without extra storage prefer keep much music downloaded can avoid streaming either due data restrictions access areas poor coverage storage up gradable gb goes top gb offers gate almost gb usable box sound qualitythe quality sound get smartphone critical me i d say place listening music podcasts number use smartphone my htc one audio tuned beats morphed boomsound whatever want call it sounds coming device listening via headphones i m happy say sound quality another feature seems would come expensive here alcatel touts sound tuned jbl option turn sound optimization settings much prefer sound feature i d say easily rivaled htc one sound quality listening device headphones there s speaker top bottom phone is part necessary upside down feature basically pick call properly orientated regardless right side not don t find feature something use me see function regardless feature two speakers part makes sound great some newer phones asus zenfone looks dual front speakers reality speaker top bottom idol gets loud listening device louder one love feature makes listening music podcasts shower nice easy hear speakers don t even seem become over burdened full volume sound quality par screen giving idol features feel much better quality you d expect price range usabilityandroid lollipop comes standard i think gate near stock most non stock features removable i ve grown love stock android vs skinned version it determining factor idol the general day to day use idol perfectly adequate overwhelmingly speedy first part felt you get pay for that s say it s functional much is where found lack speed factor selling moto g thoughts idol there issues multi tasking easily able switch music maps browser game things bit pokey respond not pokey sense takes seconds life you sometimes program might take seconds longer open you d see top of the line processor ram setup those seconds seem annoying sometimes speaks lack patience reality works perfectly well vast majority users call quality perfectly adequate probably someone even speak that spend maybe minutes week using smartphone actual phone minutes work well come across clearly person end speakerphone benefit dual speakers song podcast does i feel hardware buttons would nicer placed littler lower due phone s size issues pressing unlock button hand not massive issues since i ve almost always used two hands phone people hand device might if i m honest think stupid reason buy phone tend adapt whatever device select own usb port headphone jack you d expect them bottom top respectively battery lifeanother nice feature battery life don t consider super heavy user screen time basic day i d easily get home work make bed more having recent vacation heavy camera use gps found slightly nervous battery life charges quickly minutes think driving minutes place another could give quick boost take nervousness away overall solid battery life and think people s usage camerahere get mp rear facing camera mp front facing camera selfies all all happy camera performance in well lit situations shots clear crisp some low light situations mad poorer quality pictures that s every camera phone ever biggest struggle camera actually cloudy day used camera s time lapse video function film boat trip took lake superior see struggles it s focus makes land look rather dark cloudy sky could user error however i m sure like every smartphone there there s hdr function menu give little definition shots think worked well would expect stuck camera s auto mode part check gallery here see shots sorts lighting conditions other sun blare straight camera lens overly dark shots really liked camera gave me anything see negative camera reality using smartphone main camera due convenience they never going perform best point and shoot units decent performance nice idol step two decent final verdicti don t think get much money pay anywhere else idol is easily worth extra you d spending moto g hot running asus zenfone gb ram version picked idol superior sound quality screen think better asus know oneplus s lower cost right now lack mirco sd card took running me keep lot music phone overall trade off less expensive off contract phones oneplus asus focused making responsive powerful alcatel focused better media experience don t think go wrong three options idol onetouch easily me and miss it as alluded earlier back htc one got little desire become ansel adams may may dropped idol river northern wisconsin i d love get another idol it s currently budget do works even can t update it plan wait next year see onetouch bring alcatel made statement device hope see continue making phones budget price specs usability outweigh budget price point

1738,never seem settle splurge latest new device regret reason another sold moto g camera terrible sold note think ridiculous wanted lte band t mobile building network coverage rural areas especially frequency supported yet many phones big screen dual band wifi price initially passed alcatel altogether seemed low end brand device changed opinion company also looked zte zmax huawei p lite idol seemed best combination affordability features very customizable near stock android lollipop great screen speakers decent build quality decent main camera seems old s fine average front facing camera too bad doesnt replaceable battery huge deal doesnt seem octa core processor lagging times although enough annoy i usually install custom software phones using while turning double tap wake uninstalling almost preinstalled apps way is because cheap smartphone devastated gets dropped cracked turn double tap wake uninstall unwanted apps install different launcher want install google keyboard careful installing sim card dont expect behave note enjoy
1739,for money think pretty screen clear expected battery life good speakers surprisingly loud clear needed thing really bugged call quality not sure sounded others end voice quality sounded hollow tinny whatever listening kept fading out pretty sure cheaper back up issues eventually decided return refund think better choice price range would huawei ascend mate bigger screen killer battery life for something cheaper go blu

1982,excellent battery life lasts day hard usage survived foot drop onto wood floor audio mostly lag free experience the flaw would lack wi fi calling t mobile
1983,summary just amazing price range i using idol days must say loving everything it people net keep talking screen speakers are can t stress enough truly amazing coming oneplus one although paper opo slightly better specs around think alcatel much better job implementing android cm did stress basic functionality operates much smoother for example typing typing anywhere whether writing email texting whatever extremely responsive after used opo almost year gotten used type little slow on idol speed type means get work emails done faster love see many people talk fact screen responsive well bright also first front facing speakers all say wow difference makes watch lot videos really enhance experience around actually smaller opo well thinner feels sturdy portable put screen protector case still pocketable also lot people asking updates well little concerned updates however right box received ota update around mb installed right away every see little lag heavy multi tasker am but feel confident related crappy lollipop guy gets latest issues smoothed know perform quite bit better isnt supposed memory leaks found my double tap wake feature works isnt reliable sure could fix software update
1985,it s awesome value was stepping nexus it s pretty close stock android minor tweaks ui mind battery life pretty i could go couple days medium usage screen crisp bright sounds loud clear and brings minor issue ringer notification volumes at lowest level bit loud call quality data speeds great experience occasional sluggishness opening switching apps as used couple days struggled get used power button left volume rocker right it s completely opposite nexus this combined larger size made awkward turn on off adjust volumes thought would enjoy larger device screen get used it perhaps kept using it would eventually get used it but compromise i d rather buy device love get go welcome back nexus for me think screen perfect size still recommend
1986,iphone s currently use daily use workouts coz small size but able read properly so instead getting tablet opted idol given price screen size i happy it use reading size right great screen brightness decent battery speakers excellent included jbl earphones good premium finish very thin bezel around slippery hands needs case sure there s ever slight delay bothersome tad slow coming snapdragon processor

1990,really screen beautiful rear camera excellent whole thing zippy the downside average real use hours full charge you must plug every night dead morning if particularly full day cellular data use think numbers would halved hours
1991,showed friends never heard it could believe alcatel put flagship qualities affordable price phone runs pretty fast smooth every apps throw at it t mobile lte sms work nicely box jbl speakers clear crisp i m debating whether keep go better deal asus zenfone gb gb memory version any references
