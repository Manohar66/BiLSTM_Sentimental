second time buying cellphone amazon as always heavy research before buying placing order my first impression was holy crap beautiful its thin slick black shiny place really something admire the first thing is huge its totally thing and wont stop thing mean inch screen makes almost tablet is called phablet screen bright crisp seriously ips opinion best choice color brightness plus saves battery people complains p screen really see difference pixel density aprox ppi pixel density iphone ppi eyes must better kepler telescope go work nasa stuff hehehehe screen size alone makes things missing totally have magnetometer but get wrong lil fella powerhouse make phat rhymes ill beats play rightthe feel sturdy wont broke easily nor recommend try break it mean come on back case grip still recommend get cover case tpu something sturdier got http www amazon com gp product b ey ss ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol it lcd screen cover plus case inside box got durrrrr charger battery a screen cover gb micro sd usb cable wall adapter and cool earphones really complete set opinion bare minimum go strolling the charger quality sturdy usb cable wall adapter about battery mah battery now last two weeks charged every days so gives approximate days battery gps wifi data network on but that s me play much phone heavy using apps social ones there application called lenovo power manages battery smart way lasts longer suggest learn use it ok opening back case nothing short easy little dent lower right side allows pull back case fast easy inside find standard sized sim card slots micro sd slot gb phone camera audio speakers and battery slot accepts mini sim cards too now dual sim must know first one the left is able use g capabilities cannot don t sweat it standard practice second sim card slot shall used second line used calls audio speaker quality and loud good lord thing noisy hehehe this id lenovo a its lenovo a totally not samsung galaxy or nevertheless bunch qualities prove quite useful why mention ask camera kid not its mp camera its really camera people might want shoot pictures quality beyond hardware pictures excellent opinion work whats app apps lot modes continuous shooting auto focus set camera quality mp you record video high quality too seems p but fact scaled lesser resolution not problem tho as always phone camera this mt m mediatek cpu quad core ghz gpu mali mp what means you its fast trust me really fast your multimedia play problems games go silk games nova anomaly korea cool it gb internal memory translates total gb real usable space gb ram make faster too multitasking lot phone now going front side phone find top brand lenovo shiny silver letters audio plug power button speaker frontal camera proximity sensor notification led frontal camera

i update as possible in bottom find silver shiny soft touch buttons micro usb slot microphone the soft buttons left right menu button home button go back button they shiny silver wont back light they visible enough darkness that s it the right side volume buttons left side nothing ok that s physical stuff now go software first thing first phone posses high grade heavy customization and such necessary going make use it able least follow instructions precisely know way around android os computer sorry that s want customize it if not then worry most sellers kind get if ask course language spanish english whatevs customize you but seriously ask them don t expect giggles and certainly ask getting placing order before ok the software tricky thing my came android rom called s xiaomijie chinese rom came english wiped installed another called s made linerty its stable me ill post links at end want customize phone there silver lining this there announce mediatek get android kitkat end
